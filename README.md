# Retail Customer Cohort Analysis

This Power BI project analyzes customer retention, churn, and recovery trends for a retail business over a two-year period (December 2009 - November 2011). The dashboard provides actionable insights into cohort performance and customer behavior.

## Overview
- **Cohort Performance**: Tracks retention rates across monthly cohorts, highlighting how customer retention evolves over time.
- **Retention Breakdown**: Visualizes the proportion of new, retained, and recovered customers monthly.
- **Churn Analysis**: Identifies churned customers and calculates churn rates to pinpoint retention challenges.
- **Trend Insights**: Plots new, lost, and recovered customers over time to reveal seasonal patterns.

## Key Insights
- Early cohorts (Dec 2009 - Mar 2010) show strong initial retention (up to 79%), with a gradual decline over 12-18 months.
- Churn rates spike in later cohorts (e.g., Aug 2011 at 33%), suggesting potential issues in customer engagement.
- Recovery of lost customers increases in 2011, peaking in July (up to 94% retention in some months).
- Seasonal trends indicate higher new customer acquisition in early 2010, with recovery efforts gaining traction by mid-2011.
